# CI/CD Pipeline for Electron + Vite Application
#
# This workflow handles:
# - Quality Assurance (linting, unit tests, e2e tests)
# - Automatic versioning based on Conventional Commits
# - Changelog generation
# - Windows build with electron-builder
# - GitHub Release creation with artifacts
#
# Conventional Commits cheat sheet:
#   fix: ...     -> PATCH bump (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
#   feat: ...    -> MINOR bump (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
#   feat!: ...   -> MAJOR bump (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
#   BREAKING CHANGE: in footer -> MAJOR bump
